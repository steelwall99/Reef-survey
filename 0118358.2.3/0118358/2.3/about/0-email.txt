Hey Brian,

1.
Attached is the complete package of data books for archiving encompassing CREM (PR, STJ, and STC), 
FGBNMS Baseline Assessment (both Shallow and Tech), STEER, Jobos Bay, Guanica (Parguera/Guanica), 
Vieques, and Land Sea Characterization of STXEEMP. All of this data is up to date as of July 2014, 
including older data.

2.
Attached are also the current metadata files I have for each region. 
Metadata associated with projects spanning multiple years will be the most current one I have that 
incorporates multiple-year data. However, because I am continually challenged by metadata, I have i
ncluded all of our historic files that I have sent to CoRIS over the years. Much of it has probably 
been updated or is obsolete, but I wanted to give you what we had.

3.
Lastly, attached is also a data dictionary of sorts that explains the column/attribute 
information as well some explanations of some data reported. This also includes links for the 
sources used for biomass a/b values, trophic information and species names.


Please let me know if you have any questions

Cheers
Sarah
